# school_management

It is a School Management System with Role-Based Access Control using Django, allowing users to perform CRUD
 operations to manage student details across various classes. The system should also handle
 library history and fees history for each student, which will be managed by specific roles within
 the school.

 The system will have separate logins for different user roles: School Admin, Office Staff, and
 Librarian. The Admin will have full control over both the Office Staff and Librarians, including
 the ability to create, edit, and delete staff and librarian accounts. The Librarian will only have
 access to view library history and student details, enabling them to manage the borrowing
 records of students effectively. The Office Staff will have access to all student details, including
 the ability to view library reviews, manage fees history, and perform other administrative tasks.
